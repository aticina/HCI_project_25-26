Homepage(before login) does not have any sitemap options. (only search bar and log in button)
Homepage presents options: MY KITCHEN, LEARNING, BLOG, PROFILE AND SETTINGS.

BLOG contains posts from users. Posts contain user made recipe they wish to share with others. That post itself is not a recipe other users can insert into Cook Mode and use right away cause it is unlikely that recipe will fit app format, each recipe has to fit
app format in order for app to be able to showcase it in Cook Mode in a right way. Others can "upvote/like" a certain post and when it hits predfined number of "upvotes/likes" an admin or developer or whoever works on app will be tasked with correctlly formating
recipe from the post so it can be added to the base with other recipes and opened in Cook Mode.
